                "In the midst of a global pandemic, businesses need to reinvent their technology to conform to the heightened needs of society. Some businesses had this prior to Covid-19, but almost all businesses implement this now: maximum store occupancy. While many buildings have a maximum capacity according to fire code, many stores’ maximum capacities have been decreased due to the pandemic. This means that all buildings now need to keep an active eye on their capacity. Keeping track of a store’s occupancy can be a hassle and a financial burden. It’s unrealistic for a small business to hire an employee to count people as they enter and exit the store. KapKeep fixes this by allowing small businesses to setup cameras at entrances and exits of their store, which will keep a counter of people currently in the store. These cameras use a custom implementation of a Histogram of Oriented Gradients to detect persons in the camera feeds, as well as relay the direct video feed to a website for the owner’s usage."
